- 100, 200 taxon --> all methods - accuracy, runtime, cpu mem, gpu vram
- large cases --> stelar, astral - accuracy, runtime, cpu mem, gpu vram
- varying simulation conditions 
- ultra large case, where we can --> 
- biological trees - 1kp


writing
- therorem that all bipartitions will eventually be needed, so we precalculate them 
- time and memory complexity
- memory optimization based on permutation invariant double hashing

=================

Abstract
- quartet and triplet based methods are popular
- STELAR triplet based method
- STELAR extended now can do this, can do with ... number of taxa
- what modifications we did, effectively say about CPU, GPU paralleism
- we assess on simulated and largest biological dataset
- We believe this is a major scale forward

Intro
- will be much like recent papers
- start like there are two types - combined and summary methods
- bayesian methods are accurate but not scalable
- ASTRAL can handle thousands of taxa, however it still cannot handle ultra large datasets
- what have we done
- theoretical running time
- datasets - simulated, big biological dataset
- also ASTRAL-MP comparison

Method
- theoretical improvement
- CPU, GPU parallelism
- Evaluation studies
- which datasets, simulation, simphy parameters
- we must also show on biological datasets

Results
- Performance evaluation
	- accuracy
	- runtime
	- memory
- for some big dataset, we have to say like, we kept ASTRAL-MP on for 48/72h but got no results, but we could, or maybe memory exceeded
- Accuracy, perf improvement
- simulated - how much accuracy
- show that less time

- Also show figures for biological datasets and show that similar
	- maybe show this goes missing, or this new added
	
- also show branch support in STELAR


Experiments
keeping other things fixed
- varying number of taxa
- varying number of gene trees

in a blank overleaf, 

- dump writings
- experimental results
- simulation parameters

try to do 40k/50k taxa
assess limits on num taxa and num gene trees on 4090

- deliberately introduce ILS so that the resulting RF rate is a bit low
- 

todo
- see pairwise rf rates for generated gene trees
- also mention in paper that this sbp compression technique also applies for other algos like the one is Sir's slides, MGD DP
