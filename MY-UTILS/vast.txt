install btop
==============

# Always start in home or root to avoid path issues
cd ~

# Install build dependencies
apt update
apt install -y git build-essential cmake

# Clone btop into a fixed location
git clone https://github.com/aristocratos/btop.git /opt/btop

# Go to the source directory
cd /opt/btop

# Build and install
make
make install PREFIX=/usr/local


if not works

apt install btop

apt update
apt install -y htop

run

df -h 

and work on a big space dir, not in home 

however, /dev/... do not have exec permission normally..., so write codes in home etc, and store data in those dirs
