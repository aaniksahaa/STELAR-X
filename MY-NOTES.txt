res - 

- see MY-UTILS folder, there example command etc txt files 

todo - 

- do everything from now on MAIN branch...
- run on astral's on 10k-1k dataset 
- add supple or appendix like simulation commands, simulation params etc
- add biological analysis maybe on 1kp or something else...
- z rule - sohaib sir...
- write abstract, results, discussion, conclusion nicely, add supplementary
- add dependence on ILS
- since our memory req is now low, maybe we can strengthen by increasing the ILS - maybe giving more time / memory
- collect and accumulate the receipts from vast.ai
- 



- we can actually do the dp too with this representation, the parent bitset is just the hash of the entire range, so for (i,l1,r1,l2,r2), the hash of the range (l1,r2) will reprsent the cluster, create a hash map thus, and accordingly create the state space map 
- so we now need a way to do the intersect count function on two ranges efficiently with some data structure... and also gpu-friendly...
- since it is a binary tree, most ranges are small, so trivially traversing and comparing to find intsection may also sufficie in terms of time, 
- if we keep an inverse indexing of elements, like, pos[k][n] = where does the taxon n appear in the array number k, then we can test range membership in O(1), and hence, we can find intersection counts of two ranges A and B in O(min(|A|,|B|))...
- we have in new-approach-range-intersection-from-tuples... file in overleaf and also in MY-UTILS, use that for prompting...

bullet point contribs
- mem - n2k --> nk
- gpu, cpu
- weight comp totally isolated...
